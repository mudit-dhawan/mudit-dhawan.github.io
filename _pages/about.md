Hi, my name is Mudit Dhawan, and I am a senior at [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), India. I am interested in **machine learning** and **signal processing algorithms** for **multimedia systems** and their application to high-impact problems in **computational social sciences**. 

I am exploring the field of emotion-controlled conversational agents in task-oriented dialogue systems as a visiting student researcher at [SenticNet Lab](https://sentic.net/) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, under the guidance of [Prof. Erik Cambria](https://sentic.net/erikcambria/). I'm also a researcher at [PreCog Lab, LTRC](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/), IIIT Hyderabad, under the supervision of [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/PKguru/), where I have been exploring the field of Computational Social Science, with a particular emphasis on Multimodal Fake News and Hate Speech detection. I am fortunate to have also had the opportunity to work under and learn closely from [Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://midas.iiitd.edu.in/team/rajiv-ratn-shah.html) (IIIT Delhi) and [Prof. Rajesh Sharma](https://rajeshsharma.cs.ut.ee/index.php/Main/HomePage) (University of Tartu, Estonia). 

If you are interested in research collaboration, please drop me an email.
