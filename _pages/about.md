Hi, my name is **Mudit Dhawan**, and I am pursuing my Master’s in Machine Learning (MSML) at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/). My current research spans **neuroscience and machine learning** [with Prof. Michael J. Tarr](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/tarrlab/people/michael-j-tarr), I am analyzing **category representation in pre-trained neural models and the human brain**, aiming to understand representational alignment across artificial and biological systems.

Most recently, I was a **Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/)**, where I developed **SLM-based conversational agents for tool orchestration** using **supervised fine-tuning and GRPO**, achieving **95%+ reduction in time-to-market** for production-ready agents. I also built a **synthetic data generation pipeline** leveraging LLMs (GPT, LLaMA 70B) to simulate diverse, grounded user interactions. Our main goal was to study fine-tuning methods under resource constraint settings, along the axes of model size, and number of training data points.

Previously, under the supervision of [Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/index.html), I work on **controllable generation in diffusion models**, focusing on **text-to-music diffusion** and its vulnerabilities to **jailbreaking**, researching on memorization in diffusion models. We explored stable-audio-2, and AudioLDM models along with textual inversion to produce copyrighted music.

Prior to my graduate studies at CMU, I was a **Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research India (MSRI)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/)** advised by [Dr. Manik Varma](http://manikvarma.org/), working on **efficient and scalable machine learning** for real-world deployment—including a **query-autocomplete reformulation** deployed on Bing AI Chat and Search and a **low-latency recommendation algorithm** that outperformed production baselines. We introduced an efficient cross-encoder based ranking methodology which was successfully filled as a US Patent. 

I completed my **B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering** at [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), where I was a **Research Assistant at [Precog](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/)** advised by [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru (“PK”)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfzQyP8AAAAJ), working on **AI for Social Good** with a focus on **multimodal misinformation detection**.

If you are interested in research collaboration in **neuroscience-inspired ML, generative models, or retrieval systems**, please [email me](mailto:mdhawan@cs.cmu.edu).
