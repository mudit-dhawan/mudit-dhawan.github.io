Hi, my name is Mudit Dhawan, I am pursuing my Master's in the Machine Learning (MSML) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Where, I am exploring controllable generation in Diffusion models, specifically in Text-to-Music Diffusion Model and its application in jailbreaking under the supervision of [Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/index.html). Prior to joing CMU, I worked as a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research India (MSRI)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I was supervised by [Dr. Manik Varma](http://manikvarma.org/). My work at MSR India was in the broad area of Efficient and Scalable Machine Learning with an emphasis on real-world deployability. 

I completed my undergraduate degree from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/). During my undergrad, I was a research assistant at [Precog](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru “PK”](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfzQyP8AAAAJ), where I worked on AI for Social Good, with a focus on multimodal misinformation detection.

If you are interested in research collaboration, please drop me an email.
