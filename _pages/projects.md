## Disentanglement Perspective to Audio Style Transfer 
Advisor: Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah
- A variational autoencoder (VAE) based approach to learn disentangled representations for specified and unspecified factors of variation for audio signals to help with audio style transfer.

## Hate-Speech Based User Characterization 
Advisors: Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru and Prof. Srijan Kumar
- Analyze sentimentally charged tweets to study the effect of the network on the user’s posting activity.
- Studying the influence and susceptibility of a user based on their online neighborhood and how this network can be leveraged to determine the magnitude (or impact) of potential spreaders of hate or counter-hate on online social media platforms.

## Language Model for Code-Mix Data [[code]](https://github.com/mudit-dhawan/Probing-LLMs-Code-Mix)
Advisor: Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru
- Proposed changes in the sampling strategy and the Masked Language Modelling (MLM) Task and trained a modified XLM (Cross-Lingual  Language Model) from scratch on English-Hindi code-mixed data collected from social media.
- Weighted sampling strategy led to 15 point decrease in perplexity score on an online social media Hindi-English code mix data, and 2% increase in F1-score on the downstream POS-Tagging task on LINCE Dataset.

## Content Driven User Identity Linkage [[code]](https://github.com/mudit-dhawan/LinkingProfiles)
Advisor: Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru
- Aimed at classifying whether different profiles on Social-Media-Platforms, belong to the same person or not.
- Created a heterogeneous graph-embedding with user-nodes and content-nodes based on NERTagging, Image-Captioning, and textual-stylometric techniques on the posted user-content
