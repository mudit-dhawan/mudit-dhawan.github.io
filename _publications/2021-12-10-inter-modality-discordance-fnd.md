      Abstract
    </summary>
      The paradigm shift in the consumption of news via online platforms has cultivated the growth of digital journalism. Contrary to traditional media, lowering entry barriers and enabling everyone to be part of content creation have disabled the concept of centralized gatekeeping in digital journalism. This in turn has triggered the production of fake news. Current studies have made a significant effort towards multimodal fake news detection with less emphasis on exploring the discordance between the different multimedia present in a news article. We hypothesize that fabrication of either modality will lead to dissonance between the modalities, and resulting in misrepresented, misinterpreted and misleading news. In this paper, we inspect the authenticity of news coming from online media outlets by exploiting relationship (discordance) between the textual and multiple visual cues. We develop an inter-modality discordance based fake news detection framework to achieve the goal. The modal-specific discriminative features are learned, employing the cross-entropy loss and a modified version of contrastive loss that explores the inter-modality discordance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages information from different components of the news article (i.e., headline, body, and multiple images) for multimodal fake news detection. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets to show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by an average F1-score of 6.3%.
